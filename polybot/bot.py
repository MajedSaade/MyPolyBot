IMPORTANT:
- Format each song as a separate numbered item
- Make sure all YouTube links are direct, valid links that work when clicked
- Use the format https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID for all YouTube links
- Do not use shortened URLs or mobile (m.youtube.com) links
- Verify that each song actually exists and matches the preferences
- Do not include any markdown formatting in the links, just provide the plain URL
- Only recommend songs that are actually available on YouTube
- Test each YouTube link to ensure it's a valid, working link to an existing video

Example of good formatting for one song:

1. Song Title: Example Song
Artist Name: Example Artist
Year of Release: 2000
YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Description: This upbeat track perfectly captures the happy mood with its catchy melody and energetic performance.
